# 🔐 Admin Access Guide

## Current Admin Access Issue

Your voting system has admin functionality, but there's a mismatch between the hardcoded credentials in `admin_login.php` and the database.

## 🔧 How to Fix Admin Access

### Option 1: Use the Admin Access Helper (Recommended)
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/admin_access_helper.php
2. Click "Reset Admin Password to 'himanshu123'"
3. Then go to: http://localhost:8080/admin_login.php
4. Login with:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `himanshu123`

### Option 2: Find the Current Password
The current admin password hash in your database is: `cd2104300d75dc8a15336c14cb98cdd5`

This is an MD5 hash. You can try common passwords or use the helper script to identify it.

## 📊 Available Admin Pages

Once you have admin access, you can use these admin pages:

1. **🔐 Admin Login:** http://localhost:8080/admin_login.php
2. **📊 Admin Dashboard:** http://localhost:8080/admin_dashboard.php
3. **🗃️ Admin Database:** http://localhost:8080/admin_database.php
4. **⚙️ Admin Actions:** http://localhost:8080/admin_actions.php
5. **⚡ Simple Admin Actions:** http://localhost:8080/simple_admin_actions.php (Working Alternative)
