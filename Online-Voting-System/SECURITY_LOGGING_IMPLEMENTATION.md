### Requirement 18.2: Voting Activity Logging
- ✅ Vote submissions logged without revealing vote content
- ✅ Privacy-preserving logging (only vote type recorded)
- ✅ Timestamp and user identification
- ✅ Session tracking for audit purposes

### Requirement 18.3: Admin Action Logging
- ✅ All administrative actions logged with detailed information
- ✅ Before/after values for data changes
- ✅ Affected tables and record IDs tracked
- ✅ Admin user identification and session tracking

### Requirement 18.4: Security Event Monitoring Dashboard
- ✅ Real-time security dashboard created
- ✅ Interactive filtering and search capabilities
- ✅ Statistical analysis and visualization
- ✅ Recent events monitoring with severity levels

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components

1. **SecurityLogger Class** (`includes/SecurityLogger.php`)
   - Core logging functionality
   - Database and file logging
   - Statistics generation
   - Event retrieval methods

2. **Database Tables**
   - `security_auth_logs` - Authentication attempts
   - `security_vote_logs` - Voting activities
   - `security_admin_logs` - Administrative actions
   - `security_events` - General security events

3. **Log Files** (`logs/security/`)
   - Daily log files for backup
   - JSON format for structured data
   - Automatic rotation and cleanup

4. **Security Dashboard** (`security_dashboard.php`)
   - Real-time monitoring interface
   - Statistical visualizations
   - Event filtering and search

## 📊 Features

### Authentication Logging
```php
SecurityLogger::logAuthenticationAttempt($username, $success, $loginType, $failureReason);
```
- Tracks all login attempts
- Records IP addresses and user agents
- Identifies brute force attempts
- Supports both user and admin logins

### Voting Activity Logging
```php
SecurityLogger::logVotingActivity($username, $voteType);
```
- Privacy-preserving vote logging
- Records vote type (language, team, both)
- No actual vote content stored
- Maintains audit trail for integrity

### Admin Action Logging
```php
SecurityLogger::logAdminAction($adminUsername, $actionType, $description, $table, $recordId, $oldValues, $newValues);
```
- Comprehensive admin activity tracking
- Before/after value comparison
- Detailed action descriptions
- Affected data identification

### Security Event Logging
```php
SecurityLogger::logSecurityEvent($eventType, $severity, $description, $additionalData);
```
- General security event tracking
- Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- Flexible additional data storage
- Automated event correlation

## 🔧 Integration Points
