- [ ] Set configuration files to 600 permissions (rw-------)
- [ ] Set log files to 640 permissions (rw-r-----)
- [ ] Create .htaccess files to protect sensitive directories

### Directory Protection
- [ ] Protect /config directory from web access
- [ ] Protect /logs directory from web access  
- [ ] Protect /includes directory from web access
- [ ] Protect /backups directory from web access
- [ ] Remove or secure any test/debug files

## 2. Database Security ✅

### Connection Security
- [ ] Use dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Set secure MySQL configuration (sql_mode, charset)
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and timeout settings
- [ ] Log database connection attempts and failures

### Access Control
- [ ] Remove default/test database accounts
- [ ] Disable remote root access
- [ ] Use prepared statements for all queries
- [ ] Implement database user privilege separation
- [ ] Regular database security audits

## 3. Web Server Security

### Apache/Nginx Configuration
- [ ] Disable server signature and version disclosure
- [ ] Configure secure SSL/TLS settings (TLS 1.2+)
- [ ] Implement HTTP security headers
- [ ] Disable unnecessary HTTP methods
- [ ] Configure proper error pages (no information disclosure)

### PHP Security
- [ ] Disable dangerous PHP functions (exec, shell_exec, system)
- [ ] Set secure PHP configuration (display_errors=Off in production)
- [ ] Enable PHP error logging
- [ ] Set appropriate memory and execution limits
- [ ] Disable PHP version disclosure

## 4. Application Security ✅

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2)
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Implement session timeout and regeneration
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to all forms
- [ ] Implement proper logout functionality

### Input Validation & Output Encoding
- [ ] Validate all user inputs server-side
- [ ] Use prepared statements for database queries
- [ ] Implement XSS protection (htmlspecialchars)
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Sanitize file uploads and limit file types

### Security Headers
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

## 5. Logging & Monitoring ✅

### Security Logging
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts
- [ ] Log administrative actions
- [ ] Log security events and violations
- [ ] Implement log rotation and retention
- [ ] Secure log file permissions and access

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Track unusual voting patterns
- [ ] Monitor file system changes
- [ ] Set up alerts for security events
- [ ] Regular security log reviews

## 6. Backup & Recovery

### Backup Security
- [ ] Encrypt database backups
- [ ] Secure backup storage location
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Implement automated backup scheduling
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

### Data Protection
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Secure data disposal procedures
- [ ] Regular data integrity checks
- [ ] Backup configuration files
- [ ] Version control for code changes

## 7. Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- [ ] Configure host-based firewall
- [ ] Restrict database port access
- [ ] Block unnecessary services and ports
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Configure intrusion detection

### SSL/TLS Security
- [ ] Use strong SSL certificates
- [ ] Disable weak cipher suites
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning
- [ ] Regular certificate renewal
- [ ] Test SSL configuration

## 8. System Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Keep OS packages updated
- [ ] Update PHP and web server regularly
- [ ] Update database software
- [ ] Apply security patches promptly
- [ ] Monitor security advisories

### Security Audits
- [ ] Regular vulnerability scans
- [ ] Code security reviews
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Configuration audits
- [ ] Access control reviews

## 9. Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Identify security contacts and escalation
- [ ] Prepare forensic tools and procedures
- [ ] Create communication templates
- [ ] Regular incident response drills

### Detection & Response
- [ ] Monitor security logs continuously
- [ ] Implement automated alerting
- [ ] Document incident handling procedures
- [ ] Create evidence preservation procedures
- [ ] Post-incident review and improvement

## 10. Compliance & Documentation

### Documentation
- [ ] Security architecture documentation
- [ ] Configuration management procedures
- [ ] User access management procedures
- [ ] Change management procedures
- [ ] Security training materials

### Compliance
- [ ] Data protection compliance (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] Security framework compliance
- [ ] Regular compliance audits
- [ ] Risk assessment documentation
- [ ] Security policy documentation

## Implementation Priority

## Verification Commands

### Check File Permissions
```bash
find /path/to/voting-system -type f -name "*.php" -exec ls -la {} \;
find /path/to/voting-system -type d -exec ls -ld {} \;
```

### Check Configuration Security
```bash
ls -la /path/to/voting-system/config/
cat /path/to/voting-system/config/.htaccess
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-voting-system.com
```

### Check Database Security
```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'voting_user'@'localhost';
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```

This checklist should be reviewed and updated regularly as new security threats emerge and system requirements change.
