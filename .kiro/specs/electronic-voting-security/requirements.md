# Security Requirements Document - Online Voting System

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive security requirements for the Online Voting System developed by Himanshu Kumar. The system is a web-based voting platform that allows users to vote for their favorite programming languages and best team members. The system includes user registration, authentication, voting functionality, real-time results display, and comprehensive admin panel for system management. The platform uses PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap technologies with modern UI/UX design elements.

## Security Requirements
